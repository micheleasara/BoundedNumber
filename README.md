# What is this?

This is a simple C++ example of a `BoundedNumber` template that restricts values to a specified range (Min, Max). It supports both integer and floating-point types, and demonstrates clamping values within the bounds.

### Features:
- Clamping of out-of-range values at runtime.
- Static type checking when instantiating the template.
- Restricted numeric casting.

### How to Use:
1. Compile the `main.cpp` file.
2. The examples in the `main` function show how to use `BoundedNumber` with both integer and floating-point types.
